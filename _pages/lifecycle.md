# Lifecycle

A _lifecycle_ can be defined as **“a series of stages through which elements passes during their lifetime.”** Central to the definition of lifecycles are the concepts of stages and lifetime. A _stage_ typically defines a set of characteristics that are shared by all elements in that stage. For example, individuals during their academic lifecycle can be in the high-school, undergrad or grad stages, indicating the amount of years of education they have accumulated.
A _lifetime_ indicates the paths elements can navigate from one stage to another stage. Going back to the education example, we can say that finishing all courses is the path required to change to the next stage.

Processes also have lifecycles such as the PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle people often use to describe a process improvement agenda. In the PDCA lifecycle the stages are Plan, Do, Check and Act and a streamlined lifetime cycles through P -> D -> C -> A and may go back to P.
However, given we are dealing with processes that are knowledge intensive, we have defined a more comprehensive lifecycle to better convey the concepts we work with. Our lifecycle is organized using 4 stages and 8 paths represented as transitions or operations. The 4 stages are: _Concepts Stage_, _Models Stage_, _Instances Stage_ and _Knowledge Graphs Stage_. The 8 possible paths are: _Materialize Transition_, _Specialize Operation_, _Tailor Operation_, _Instanciate Transition_, _Execute Transition_, _Improve Operation_, _Harmonize Operation_ and _Recommend Operation_. The difference between a transition and an operation is that transitions force a stage change whereas operations do not and may only produce an output.

The figure bellow illustrates how stages and transitions are combined to define the AgileKip lifecycle we use to support the discussions of our research.
