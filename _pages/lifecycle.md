# Lifecycle

A lifecycle is defined as “a series of stages through which something (such as an individual, culture, or manufactured product) passes during its lifetime.” Processes have life cycles as they are created, executed and in some way finalized during their lifetime. There are special cycles related to processes such as the PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle people ofter use to describe process improvement. However we have defined a more comprehensive lifecycle to better express all the concepts we work with. Our lifecycle is organized using stages (or views) and transitions (or operations). A stage indicates processes in that stage share to some characteristics and they can be Conceptual Stage, Model Stage, Instance Stage and History Stage. A transition represents a procedure that creates or modifies some elements of the given process and they can be Materialize Transition, Specialize Operation, Tailor Operation, Instanciate Transition, Execute Transition, Improve Operation, Harmonize Operation and Recommend Operation.

The figuge bellow illustrates how stages and transitions are combined to define the lifecycle we use to support the discussions of our research.
